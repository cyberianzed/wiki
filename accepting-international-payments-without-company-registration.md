# Accepting International Payments Without Company Registration

When you're just starting out, you might want to avoid the legal hassle of company registration. In this case, you can still accept payments by using a payment gateway that acts as a merchant of record.

## What is a Merchant of Record (MoR)?

A Merchant of Record is a legal entity that sells goods or services to end customers, handling transactions on behalf of the actual seller. The MoR takes responsibility for payment processing, tax compliance, and legal obligations.

**Advantages:**
- Handles international tax compliance and regulations
- Manages payment processing and refunds
- Takes on legal liability for transactions
- Simplifies cross-border selling

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher transaction fees compared to direct payment processing
- Less control over the customer relationship
- Potential delays in receiving payouts
- Limited customization of checkout experience
- Chance of getting banned for terms violation
