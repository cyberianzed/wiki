# Accepting International Payments Without Company Registration

Without a legal entity, you will have to use a payment gateway that is a merchant of record.

## What is a Merchant of Record (MoR)?

A Merchant of Record is a legal entity that sells goods or services to end customers, handling transactions on behalf of the actual seller. The MoR takes responsibility for payment processing, tax compliance, and legal obligations.

**Advantages:**
- Handles international tax compliance and regulations
- Manages payment processing and refunds
- Takes on legal liability for transactions
- Simplifies cross-border selling

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher transaction fees compared to direct payment processing
- Less control over the customer relationship
- Potential delays in receiving payouts
- Limited customization of checkout experience
- Chance of getting banned for terms violation
