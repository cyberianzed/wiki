# Alternative Options to Stripe for SaaS Payment, Sales Tax, and Billing Management

When evaluating alternative solutions to Stripe, we broke down the exploration into three main sections: Payments, Sales Tax, and Billing. Below is a comprehensive summary of our findings:

### 1. Payments

**Outcome**: We determined that switching from Stripe for payments was not viable. Stripe excels in this area and provides unparalleled service.

**Recommendation**: Continue using Stripe for payment processing due to its robust infrastructure and market leadership.

### 2. Sales Tax Solutions

We explored various solutions for handling sales tax compliance, focusing on pricing, features, and ease of use:

#### a. Avalara

* **Pros**: Strong overall impression, reliable service for sales tax compliance.
* **Features**: Automated sales tax calculation, reporting, and compliance.
* **Limitations**: Does not handle physical presence nexus (state-specific obligations).
* **Pricing**: Starts at approximately $8,000 to $10,000 per year.

#### b. Anrok

* **Pros**: Modern UX and capable of handling physical presence nexus, making it versatile for businesses with complex tax obligations.
* **Features**: Comprehensive sales tax management, including support for different nexus types.
* **Pricing**: Similar to Avalara, starting around $8,000 to $10,000 per year.

**Alternative Approach**: For businesses that only need to comply with sales tax in a few states, manual calculation can be a cost-effective alternative. An accountant can be engaged to remit and file the necessary paperwork. This may be a practical approach for companies with a concentrated customer base.

### 3. Billing Management Solutions

We identified two main contenders as alternatives to Stripe Billing:

#### a. Maple Billing

* **Pros**: Founded by a team with extensive experience in the field. Offers a straightforward pricing model and high reliability.
* **Pricing**: Flat rate between $6,000 and $12,000 per year, depending on usage.
* **Best For**: Companies looking for a simpler, more predictable billing solution without unnecessary complexity.

#### b. Lago

* **Pros**: A Y Combinator-backed company with advanced features and extensive customization options.
* **Cons**: More complex than Maple Billing, which may not be ideal for businesses needing simpler solutions.
* **Pricing**: Starts at approximately $10,000 per year.
* **Best For**: Organizations that need comprehensive, feature-rich billing software and are comfortable with a higher degree of complexity.

### Additional Insights

* **State Sales Tax Requirements**: Businesses primarily serving the tech industry may only need to address sales tax in a few states due to market concentration. This reduces the necessity for an automated solution and supports the case for manual management.
* **Market Opportunities**: The sales tax and billing management space is relatively sparse. Many companies that achieve significant growth are quickly acquired by larger players. There is potential for new entrants to develop fixed-cost, high-value products that could fill this gap.

### Conclusion

While Stripe remains unmatched for payment processing, there are feasible alternatives for sales tax and billing management. For businesses considering switching from Stripe Billing or exploring tax solutions, **Maple Billing** and **Avalara**/ **Anrok** are viable choices based on budget and complexity requirements. For some, a manual approach for sales tax compliance might be a strategic, cost-effective option.
